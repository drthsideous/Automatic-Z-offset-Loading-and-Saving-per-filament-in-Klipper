I have all of my macros in a separate macros folder in klipper to keep things more
organized. And use [INCLUDE macros/MACRO_NAME.cfg] to run my various macros.
For example:
#All Macros List here
[include macros/FILAMENT_Z_ADJUST.cfg]
[include macros/END_PRINT.cfg]
[include macros/UNLOAD_FILAMENT.cfg]
[include macros/LOAD_FILAMENT.cfg]
[include macros/START_PRINT.cfg]
[include macros/SAVE_Z_ADJUST.cfg]
[include macros/REAPPLY_FILAMENT_OFFSET.cfg]
[include macros/PROBE_OFFSET_GUARD.cfg]

This works for me, but you should be able to add my macros to your printer.cfg and run 
them the same. Although I have not tested this. I reccomend setting up a different macros folder
though, /config/macros. As this will keep things tidy, and allow you to trouble shoot thing easier
if problems arise.

The macros you need to add are:
[SAVE_Z_ADJUST]
[REAPPLY_FILAMENT_OFFSET]
[PROBE_OFFSET_GUARD]
[FILAMENT_Z_ADJUST]

"saved_variables.cfg" needs to be added to your main config path /config
The same path that your printer.cfg is in. NOT in a macros folder /config/macros.
This is where your filament offsets will be stored.
You can edit this file to add any filament types you use, just make sure it is written the same way
that Orca writes it. I just included the most common types I use.

There are several lines of code that need to be added in existing .cfg and macros.

There are two files with lines that need to be added to your START_PRINT and END_PRINT macros.
They are "Add to START_PRINT MACRO.txt" and "Add to END PRINT MACRO.txt"
If you do not have START_PRINT and END_PRINT macros, this whole thing will not work for you.
I've also included my START_PRINT and END_PRINT macros so you can see how I incorporated these
lines, and also for others to use if they do not have them. No garauntee they will work with your
set up though.

"Add to printer cfg.txt" has lines that need to be added to your printer.cfg

"Orca Slicer Lines.txt" has lines that need to replace your Start and End print gcode in Orca.

I'll be honest, if you have any issues, I probably can't solve them. But I was able to 
troubleshoot and create all of this with chatgpt by feeding in and asking it to write these
macros with my existing printer.cfg and macros. And if I ran into an error, I fed the error
chatgpt and it would tell me how and what to change. So if I can figure it out, I'm sure
others can. Cause again, I have very little idea what I'm doing.
